Analysis of ALL possible sgRNAs targets in sequence(s) from sequences.fas

		Started at 2019-02-18 15:34:52

Conditions:
==========
		Seed sequence size = 11 nucleotides
	L0 (NO mismatch in seed sequence)  -> Possible offtarget if global mismatches are less than 6
	L1 (1 mismatch in seed sequence)   -> Possible offtarget if global mismatches are less than 5
	Take into account offtargets with "NAG" PAM?  No
